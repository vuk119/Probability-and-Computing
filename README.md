# Probability-and-Computing

Coming across a subject Probability and Computing for MSc in Computer Science at Oxford (https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2017-2018/probability/) I realised that the topic is very interesting. Therefore, I took a book Probability and Computing, by Michael Mitzenmacher and Eli Upfal, from a library and started learning the subject. I intend to listen to lectures in the next term and if approved to sit the exam. 

Here I will present some of the assignments from the book, and later put personal projects related to the topic.


#Why probability in computing?

Probability has many applications in computing. Here I will just briefly mention some of them.
Probabilistic methods could be used to analyse complexities of algorithms. On the other hand, one could develope an algorithm that gives the correct solution with a certain probability. This algorithm might run much faster than other algorithms. Furthermore, some NP-hard problems such as Hamiltonian cycle could be solved in polynomial time with high a probability.
